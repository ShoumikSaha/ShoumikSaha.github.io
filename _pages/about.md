I am a 3rd year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Maryland - College Park](https://umd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Soheil Feizi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~sfeizi/).
Last summer, I have worked as a Scientist Intern at Amazon AWS.
While I started my research career focusing in **machine learning for security** by working 
in malware detection, my interest gradually shifted to **security and reliability for machine learning**.
These days, I am working on making genAI, especially LLM, robust and reliable.
If you look into my [CV](../assets/pdf/Shoumik_CV_2024_Oct.pdf), you will notice that -- 
I love to think and work from the both perspective, attack/defense, red-team/blue-team,
whatever the way you want to define it. Sounds interesting? 
Feel free to reach out to me about my research, or future collaboration.

Before joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my B.Sc. from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).
Then I worked as a full-time lecturer at the United International University, and 
part-time research assistant at the research lab of BUET.
