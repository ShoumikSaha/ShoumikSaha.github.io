I am a 3rd year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Maryland - College Park](https://umd.edu/), 
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Soheil Feizi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~sfeizi/).
Last summer, I have worked as a Scientist Intern at Amazon AWS.
My research journey began with a focus on **machine learning for security**, 
particularly in malware detection. Over time, my interests have evolved toward 
**security and reliability in machine learning**. 
These days, I’m dedicated to enhancing the robustness and reliability of generative AI, 
especially large language models (LLMs).

If you check out my [CV](../assets/pdf/Shoumik_CV_2024_Oct.pdf), you'll see a consistent theme: 
I enjoy exploring challenges from both sides of the coin—attack and defense, red team and blue team, 
or however you’d like to frame it. Sounds interesting? 
Feel free to reach out to discuss my research or potential collaborations!

Before joining the Ph.D. program, I earned my B.Sc. from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).
I then gained valuable experience as a full-time lecturer at United International University 
and a part-time research assistant at BUET's research lab.
