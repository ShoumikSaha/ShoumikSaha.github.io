I am a 3rd year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Maryland - College Park](https://umd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Soheil Feizi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~sfeizi/).
My research interest lies in the intersection of machine learning and computer security.
While I started my research career focusing in **machine learning for security** by working 
in malware detection, my interest gradually shifted to **security and reliability for machine learning**.
These days, I am working on making genAI, especially LLM, robust and reliable.
If you look into my [CV](../assets/pdf/Shoumik_CV_2024_Oct.pdf), you will notice that -- 
I love to think and work from the both perspective, attack/defense, red-team/blue-team,
whatever the way you want to define it. Sounds interesting? 
Feel free to contact me about my research, or future collaboration.



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
