<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a 3rd year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://umd.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Maryland - College Park</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~sfeizi/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Soheil Feizi</a>. Last summer, I have worked as a Scientist Intern at Amazon AWS. While I started my research career focusing in <strong>machine learning for security</strong> by working in malware detection, my interest gradually shifted to <strong>security and reliability for machine learning</strong>. These days, I am working on making genAI, especially LLM, robust and reliable. If you look into my <a href="../assets/pdf/Shoumik_CV_2024_Oct.pdf">CV</a>, you will notice that â€“ I love to think and work from the both perspective, attack/defense, red-team/blue-team, whatever the way you want to define it. Sounds interesting? Feel free to reach out to me about my research, or future collaboration.</p> <p>Before joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my B.Sc. from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). Then I worked as a full-time lecturer at the United International University, and part-time research assistant at the research lab of BUET.</p> </body></html>
